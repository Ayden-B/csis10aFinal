# csis10aFinal
I have decided to create a calculator as my final project. It will take in a full equation, analyze it, and return the result.

Operating Notes:
* Please use "*" for multiplication and "/" for division.
  - Example: "3*4" or "3/4".
  - "3x4" will not work as x is assumed to be an unknown variable
* If you would like to utilize the result of a previous equation as
  a variable you can use that equation's EQ-key (Ex: "(EQ1)" for
  the first equation), or simply "ANS" for the most recent result.
  Remember that all inserts ("ANS", "EQ_") should be in all-caps
* To view all previous equations, type "EQH"instead of an equation
* Any equation that results in an error message will not be recorded
  in the equation history, but will allow you to continue calculating
* Type "QUIT" to stop calculating.
